# Bikeshare-Data-Analysis
This is the first part of my series on data analysis projects. This version deals with descriptive statistics. It is about the most popular  methods of transport- bikeshares. The uniqueness  of this project lies in the user friendly environment it creates and not the complexity of the code
The key features of this project are:
1) Efficient use of numpy and pandas functions to deal with data
2) Ability to deal with invalid input without Exceptions and errors in output
3) Ability to scan large datasets and compute decriptive statistics quickly ad accurately
4) User-friendly analysis
